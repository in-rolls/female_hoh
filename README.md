## Female HoH

We use the [SECC data](https://github.com/in-rolls/secc) to estimate what proportion of households have a female head of household and how the proportion of female hoh varies by last name and by SC/ST/Other. We also estimate the average age of female and male hoh. We find that just X% of households have a female HoH. The proportion varies widely across last names, with the 10th percentile being Y% and the 90th percentile being Z%. The average age of female HoH is K years vs. L years for male HoH.
